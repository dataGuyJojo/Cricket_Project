# ICC T20 Men's World Cup Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the ICC T20 Men's World Cup data using SQL for data transformation and Power BI for visualization. The goal is to derive key insights into team and player performances through interactive dashboards.

## Data Sources

- **Cricket_Project_Raw.csv**: The original dataset from Kaggle.
- **Cricket_Project_modified**: The cleaned and structured dataset after applying SQL transformations.
- **who_won_which_match**: A derived dataset focusing on match winners.

## Data Processing

The data was transformed using SQL queries stored in:

- **Cricket_Analysis_Project.sql**: Contains SQL scripts for cleaning, transforming, and extracting meaningful insights from the raw data.

## Dashboards

The analysis is presented through three Power BI dashboards:

1. **Best Performing Team**: Identifies the most successful teams based on match results.
2. **Best Performing Batsman**: Highlights top batsmen based on runs, strike rates, and consistency.
3. **Player Insights**: Allows users to search for a specific player and analyze their performance across different matches.

Each dashboard includes filters to allow dynamic data exploration.

## Files Included

- **Completed_Cricket.pbix**: The Power BI file containing all dashboards.
- **Cricket_Analysis_Project.sql**: SQL file used to modify and process the raw data.
- **Cricket_Project_Raw.csv**: The original dataset.
- **Cricket_Project_modified**: The cleaned dataset.
- **who_won_which_match**: Extracted match winner information.
- **Dashboard_Report.pdf**: A document containing screenshots and descriptions of the dashboards.
